### noop_tool:
During a complex task execution, the reflection phase can lead to agent-zero's decision to perform another round of observations, thoughts and reflections based on the previous round
This tool is used to perform a noop operation, it does nothing and is used to satisfy the tool call requirement. This way the agent can continue with the next round of observations, thoughts and reflections.
It should be used as many times as needed to successfullyconclude the agent'sreasoning process
It is a tool the agent should use to correct its own reasoning mistakes
Agent-Zero should strive for the best possible outcome and should not be afraid to perform multiple rounds of observations, thoughts and reflections.
