# Task Scheduler Implementation Status

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the current state of the Task Scheduler implementation in Agent Zero based on actual code examination.

## Current Implementation Status

### Backend (`python/helpers/task_scheduler.py`, `python/api/scheduler_*.py`)
- ✅ Core `TaskScheduler` class managing task list persistence (`memory/scheduler/tasks.json`) and execution logic
- ✅ `SchedulerTaskList` handles loading/saving tasks with file locking (`threading.RLock`)
- ✅ Task Models:
  - ✅ `ScheduledTask` (cron-based) using `TaskSchedule` for cron expression representation
  - ✅ `AdHocTask` (token-based) for on-demand execution
  - ✅ `PlannedTask` (date-based) using `TaskPlan` for managing todo/in-progress/done items
- ✅ Task States: `TaskState` enum (`idle`, `running`, `disabled`, `error`) used
- ✅ Atomic Updates: `update_task` method provides atomic updates to task state/properties
- ✅ Background Execution: Tasks run in background threads via `DeferredTask`
- ✅ Check Schedule Implementation:
  - ✅ Each task type implements its own `check_schedule()` method for determining when to run
  - ✅ `BaseTask.check_schedule()` returns `False` by default
  - ✅ `ScheduledTask.check_schedule()` uses CronTab to check time-based schedule
  - ✅ `PlannedTask.check_schedule()` checks `plan.should_launch()` for datetime-based execution
- ✅ Execution Lifecycle Hooks:
  - ✅ `on_run()` called when task starts running
  - ✅ `on_success()` called when task completes successfully
  - ✅ `on_error()` called when task encounters an error
  - ✅ `on_finish()` called after task completes (success or error)
- ✅ API Endpoints:
    - ✅ `scheduler_tick.py`: Checks for due tasks (`tick()`). Loopback only, likely triggered externally (e.g., cron)
    - ✅ `scheduler_task_run.py`: Manually runs a task by UUID. Includes state checks
    - ✅ `scheduler_task_create.py`: Creates new `ScheduledTask`, `AdHocTask`, or `PlannedTask`
    - ✅ `scheduler_task_delete.py`: Deletes a task by UUID
    - ✅ `scheduler_task_update.py`: Updates task properties (name, state, prompts, schedule/token, etc.) using atomic update
    - ✅ `scheduler_tasks_list.py`: Lists all tasks with details (including type-specific fields)

### Frontend Integration (`webui/js/scheduler.js`, `webui/index.html`, `webui/css/settings.css`)
- ✅ Settings Modal Integration: Dedicated "Task Scheduler" tab in the settings modal (`settings.js`, `index.html`)
- ✅ Alpine.js Component: `schedulerSettings` (`scheduler.js`) manages the UI state for the tab
- ✅ Task List Display: Fetches tasks via `/scheduler_tasks_list` and displays them in a sortable, filterable table
    - ✅ Filtering by Type (scheduled, adhoc, planned) and State (idle, running, etc.)
    - ✅ Sorting by Name, State, Last Run
- ✅ CRUD Operations UI:
    - ✅ "New Task" button opens creation form
    - ✅ Edit/Delete buttons per task
    - ✅ Task creation/editing form (`scheduler-form`) with fields for name, type, schedule/token/plan, prompts, attachments
- ✅ Task Actions:
    - ✅ Run Task button calls `/scheduler_task_run`
    - ✅ Reset State button calls `/scheduler_task_update` to set state to `idle`
- ✅ State Display: Uses status badges (`scheduler-status-badge`) with specific classes (`scheduler-status-idle`, etc.)
- ✅ Polling: Automatically polls `/scheduler_tasks_list` every 2 seconds when the tab is active
- ✅ Detail View: Clicking a task row shows a detailed view (`scheduler-detail-view`)
- ✅ Tab Selection Handling: Includes specific logic (`scheduler.js`, `settings.js`) to handle reactivity issues when selecting the scheduler tab, often involving a two-step activation

### Context Management (`agent.py`, `persist_chat.py`, `poll.py`)
- ✅ Unified Context Storage: Task contexts are stored alongside regular chat contexts in `tmp/chats/` (`persist_chat.py`)
- ✅ Context Identification: A context is identified as a "task" context if its UUID matches a task UUID in the `TaskScheduler` (`poll.py`)
- ✅ Context Creation/Loading: `TaskScheduler._get_chat_context` handles loading existing contexts or creating new ones (`__new_context`) for tasks, associating them with the task UUID

## Recent Critical Fixes (Reflected in Current Code)

### Context Storage Consolidation
- ✅ Code confirms contexts are stored in `tmp/chats/`
- ✅ Identification via UUID matching in `TaskScheduler` is implemented in `poll.py`
- ✅ `persist_chat.py` handles the unified location

### Settings Modal Tab Selection Fix
- ✅ `scheduler.js` contains a global click listener specifically for the scheduler tab
- ✅ `settings.js` includes logic potentially involving a two-step switch (`switchTab`) when the scheduler tab is involved, though the primary fix seems to be the global listener in `scheduler.js`
- ✅ CSS in `settings.css` uses consistent border handling (`border-bottom: 3px solid transparent` / `border-bottom-color`) to prevent content jumps

### Thread Safety in Task Execution
- ✅ `PlannedTask.on_success()` uses a lock to ensure thread-safe updates to the plan's in-progress state
- ✅ `PlannedTask.on_error()` implements the same pattern to mark plan items as done when errors occur
- ✅ Critical state updates in `BaseTask` use atomic operations via the `TaskScheduler.update_task` method
- ✅ The `SchedulerTaskList` uses a reentrant lock (`threading.RLock`) for thread safety during operations

## Remaining Tasks (Based on Code Examination)

### Features Not Implemented
- ❌ Visual Cron Expression Builder (UI for creating cron strings)
- ❌ Task Execution History (No dedicated API or UI for logs/history)
- ❌ Real-time Status Monitoring (Relies on polling, no WebSockets/SSE)
- ❌ Task Templates (No API/UI for saving/using templates)
- ❌ Bulk Operations (UI only supports single-task actions)
- ❌ Advanced Attachment Handling (UI is basic textarea; no file browser/validation beyond paths)
- ❌ Advanced Plan Visualization for `PlannedTask` (No UI for visualizing the todo/in-progress/done items)

### Performance/QA/Docs Not Implemented
- ❌ Task List Performance Optimizations (No virtualization/pagination observed)
- ❌ Scheduler Service Optimization (Code seems functional, but no specific optimization evidence)
- ❌ Comprehensive Testing Suite (No dedicated test files visible in provided context)
- ❌ User Documentation (Beyond developer notes)

## Technical Notes (Confirmed/Updated)
- ✅ CSS classes use `scheduler-` prefix (`settings.css`)
- ✅ Alpine.js (`scheduler.js`) is used for frontend reactivity
- ✅ Tab selection requires special handling (`scheduler.js` global listener)
- ✅ All contexts (chats and tasks) are stored in `tmp/chats/`
- ✅ Task contexts identified by UUID match in `TaskScheduler`
- ✅ API endpoints follow `scheduler_*` pattern (`python/api/`)
- ✅ Application runs in a Docker container (`.warning-flags`)
- ✅ Each task type implements its own `check_schedule()` method for determining execution timing
- ✅ `PlannedTask` uses a `TaskPlan` object to manage todo/in-progress/done datetime items
- ✅ Thread safety is ensured through locks and atomic operations

This document will be updated as implementation progresses.
