# Task Scheduler Implementation History

## Overview
This document serves as a detailed historical record of the Task Scheduler implementation, capturing the what, how, and why of each major development decision and change. This is designed to help maintain context across different development sessions and ensure consistency in implementation.

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Backend Task Scheduler Implementation

#### Implementation Challenges:

1. **Task Model Design**: Designing flexible task models that support both scheduled and ad-hoc execution patterns.

2. **Thread Safety**: Ensuring thread-safe operations when multiple tasks might run concurrently.

3. **Context Persistence**: Implementing proper persistence for task definitions and execution contexts.

#### Implementation Solutions:

1. **Dual Task Types**: Created two distinct task types: `ScheduledTask` with cron-based scheduling and `AdHocTask` for on-demand execution.

2. **Thread Safety Features**: Implemented proper locking mechanisms for task operations to prevent race conditions.

3. **JSON Serialization**: Used Pydantic models with JSON serialization for task persistence.

4. **Context Management**: Utilized existing chat context system with task-specific adaptations.

### Phase 2: Chat Context Auto-Detection Enhancement

#### Implementation Challenges:

1. **Task Chat Reset Issue**: Task chat contexts were not properly being reset, causing old messages to reappear after application restart.

2. **Context Detection Problem**: The application was incorrectly handling the identification of chat context storage locations, leading to inconsistent behavior when resetting tasks.

3. **Persistence Inconsistency**: Reset contexts weren't being properly saved to the correct folder, causing old data to be reloaded upon restart.

#### Implementation Solutions:

1. **Intelligent Auto-Detection**: Redesigned the `get_chat_folder_path` function to actively check for context existence in both `TASKS_FOLDER` and `CHATS_FOLDER`.

2. **Complete Context Removal**: Enhanced `remove_chat` to use auto-detection to find and properly remove the entire context file.

3. **Correct Context Saving**: Updated `save_tmp_chat` to support auto-detection, ensuring reset contexts are saved to the appropriate location.

4. **Comprehensive Function Updates**: Modified related functions like `_get_chat_file_path`, `load_tmp_chats`, and `load_json_chats` to support auto-detection.

5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility by preserving the same function signatures while enhancing their internal behavior.

### Phase 3: Left Panel Task List Integration

#### Implementation Achievements:

1. **Tab-Based Interface**: Implemented a tabbed interface in the left panel with "Chats" and "Tasks" tabs.

2. **Task List Display**: Created a task list view in the left panel that displays all available tasks.

3. **Context Selection**: Enabled task selection to display the associated chat context in the main view.

4. **Persistence Features**: Implemented localStorage-based persistence for tab selection and last selected task.

5. **Reactive Updates**: Used Alpine.js for reactive UI updates when tasks are added/removed.

### Phase 4: API Endpoint Implementation

#### Implementation Achievements:

1. **Core Scheduler Tick**: Implemented `scheduler_tick.py` API endpoint to periodically check and run due tasks.

2. **Task Management Endpoints**: Created API endpoints for task management:
   - `scheduler_task_create.py` - For creating new tasks
   - `scheduler_task_delete.py` - For deleting tasks
   - `scheduler_task_update.py` - For updating existing tasks
   - `scheduler_task_run.py` - For manually running tasks
   - `scheduler_tasks_list.py` - For listing all tasks

### Phase 5: API Endpoint Completion and Manual Execution Fix

#### Implementation Challenges:

1. **Task Execution Entry Points**: The system had a confusion of responsibilities between automatic (scheduled) task execution and manual (user-triggered) task execution.

2. **Endpoint Misuse**: The frontend was using the `scheduler_tick` endpoint incorrectly for manual task execution, despite this endpoint being designed for periodic scheduled execution.

3. **Validation Gaps**: Manual task execution lacked proper validation and state checking before execution.

#### Implementation Solutions:

1. **Dedicated Run Endpoint**: Implemented the `scheduler_task_run.py` API endpoint specifically for manual task execution, with proper state validation and error handling.

2. **Frontend Integration**: Updated the `runTask` function in `scheduler.js` to use the correct `scheduler_task_run` endpoint.

3. **Clear Responsibility Separation**:
   - `scheduler_tick.py`: Only for cron-based scheduled execution checks
   - `scheduler_task_run.py`: Only for user-triggered manual execution

4. **Enhanced State Management**: Added state checking to prevent running already-running tasks and implemented proper error handling and reporting.

5. **Security Improvements**: Ensured the `scheduler_tick` endpoint requires loopback authentication while `scheduler_task_run` requires user authentication.

### Phase 6: Settings Modal Integration and Task Management Interface

#### Implementation Achievements:

1. **Modal Tab Integration**: Added a dedicated "Task Scheduler" tab to the settings modal.

2. **Task List Interface**: Implemented a robust task list table with:
   - Sorting by name, status, type, and creation date
   - Filtering by task type (scheduled/ad-hoc) and status
   - Visual status indicators with appropriate colors
   - Action buttons for each task (run, edit, delete)

3. **Task Creation Form**: Developed a comprehensive task creation form with:
   - Task name input with validation
   - Task type selector (scheduled/ad-hoc)
   - Schedule input with cron expression fields
   - Token input for ad-hoc tasks
   - System and user prompt editors
   - Context flag settings (planning, reasoning, deep search)

4. **Task Editing Capabilities**: Created an editing interface that:
   - Loads existing task data into the form
   - Validates changes before saving
   - Prevents changing immutable fields (like task type)
   - Shows validation feedback

### Phase 7: Settings Modal Tab Selection Fix

#### Implementation Challenges:

1. **Initial Tab Selection Issue**: The scheduler tab in the settings modal could not be selected on initial load, but worked after selecting another tab first.

2. **Content Jump**: A 2-pixel content jump occurred when clicking the scheduler tab.

3. **Alpine.js Reactivity Issues**: The tab selection mechanism wasn't properly triggering Alpine.js reactivity updates.

4. **Event Propagation Problems**: Click events weren't being properly handled by the tab selection mechanism.

#### Implementation Solutions:

1. **Two-Step Tab Activation Process**: Implemented a special two-step process for activating the scheduler tab:
   ```javascript
   // First switch to a known-working tab
   this.activeTab = 'agent';

   // Then after a DOM update cycle, switch to scheduler
   setTimeout(() => {
     this.activeTab = 'scheduler';
   }, 10);
   ```

2. **Global Click Interceptor**: Added a global event listener to ensure robust tab selection:
   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
     const schedulerTab = e.target.closest('.settings-tab[title="Task Scheduler"]');
     if (schedulerTab) {
       // Handle the click with special processing
     }
   }, true);
   ```

3. **Enhanced Tab Initialization**: Improved the initialization sequence for the settings modal:
   ```javascript
   // When opening the modal
   this.activeTab = localStorage.getItem('settingsActiveTab') || 'agent';

   // Special handling for scheduler tab
   if (this.activeTab === 'scheduler') {
     // Use the two-step process to ensure proper initialization
   }
   ```

4. **Improved Alpine.js Integration**: Enhanced the Alpine.js component integration to ensure proper reactivity:
   ```javascript
   // In settings.js
   switchTab(tabName) {
     console.log(`Switching tab from ${this.activeTab} to ${tabName}`);
     this.activeTab = tabName;
     localStorage.setItem('settingsActiveTab', tabName);

     // Ensure the tab is scrolled into view
     this.scrollActiveTabIntoView();
   }
   ```

5. **Debugging Support**: Added comprehensive console logging to track tab selection state and events:
   ```javascript
   console.log('DOMContentLoaded: Setting up scheduler tab click handler');
   console.log('Found scheduler tab:', schedulerTab);
   console.log('Current activeTab:', Alpine.store('settings').activeTab);
   ```

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Container Awareness
- Application runs in Docker container
- File paths must be absolute within container
- Changes outside mounted volumes don't persist
- File validation must respect container boundaries

### Naming Convention System
- All localStorage keys use camelCase
- CSS classes use component-specific prefixes
- JavaScript follows camelCase for identifiers
- Store properties use consistent naming

### Alpine.js Integration
- Store initialization is critical
- Safety checks are mandatory
- Consistent property naming required
- Error handling is essential
- Reactivity issues require special handling techniques
- Two-step process for critical tab switching operations

### Error Handling Strategy
- Clear error messages
- Proper store access checks
- Network error handling
- File system error handling

### Context Management System
- Chat contexts can be either tasks or regular chats
- Contexts are stored in either `TASKS_FOLDER` or `CHATS_FOLDER`
- Auto-detection determines the correct location
- Reset operation must preserve task association while clearing history
- Context files must be properly removed before reset to prevent data reappearance
