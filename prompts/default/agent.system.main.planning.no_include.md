## Planning Tasks Into The Future, Information Organization, Retention, Management

### tasklist
Whenever the agent encounters a coplex problem (for example "thorough research" or "multiple real-world actions taking long time and needing coordination") with many steps to be planned ahead and managed along the way, he should use the 'tasklist' family of tools. By using 'tasklist' he can create tasks, manage them, change status and reorganize the tasks along the way as well as retain the entire original tasklist and all it's changes even beyond the limits of the context window of underlying LLM.

### notepad
When the agent encounters an information intensive task like research or summarization of many long web articles, he should use the 'notepad' family of tools. By using 'notepad' he can make notes along the way and retain those notes and any changes to them even beyond the limits of the context window of underlying LLM.
