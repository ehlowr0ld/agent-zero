### code_execution_tool
- Lets you execute terminal commands as well as python and nodejs code for computation or software tasks
- Place code in "code" argument; escape carefully and indent properly
- For dialogues (Y/N etc.), use "terminal" runtime with the input as "code"
- If code runs long, use "output" runtime to wait, leave code as empty string ""
- If code runs much too long, use "reset" runtime to kill process, leave code as empty string ""
- Use "pip" "npm" "apt-get" in "terminal" to install packages
- To make visible output from your code, use print() or console.log()
- If tool outputs error, adjust code before retrying; knowledge_tool can help to solve the problems encountered
- Don't use with other tools, only with thoughts and reflections; wait for response before using others
- Check dependencies before running code
IMPORTANT: never diretly use implicit print/output as first action â€” it doesn't work!
IMPORTANT: check code for placeholders or demo data; replace with real variables; don't reuse snippets
