# Instructions to Restart Application Container

To apply the fixed Task Scheduler implementation, you need to restart the application container. Here are two methods you can use:

## Method 1: Restart Container from Host

If you have access to the Docker CLI on the host machine:

```bash
# Find the container ID or name
docker ps

# Restart the container
docker restart <container_name_or_id>
```

## Method 2: Restart Application from Inside Container

If you're connected to the container:

```bash
# Stop the current UI process
pkill -f "python app.py"

# Start it again
cd /app && python app.py
```

## Method 3: Rebuild Container (If Changes Are Not Visible)

If after restarting, the changes are still not visible, you may need to rebuild the container:

```bash
# Stop the container
docker stop <container_name_or_id>

# Remove the container (if needed)
docker rm <container_name_or_id>

# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Verifying the Changes

After restarting, access the application interface and:

1. Open the settings modal
2. Navigate to the Task Scheduler tab
3. Verify that the Task Scheduler section contains all controls and forms properly nested
4. Check that all buttons have proper styling with visible text
5. Confirm that tasks load properly when the tab is opened

If any issues persist, verify that all file changes were saved properly before restarting.
