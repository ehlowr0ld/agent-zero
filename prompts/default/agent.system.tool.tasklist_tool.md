### Category: Tasklist management
This tool enables the agent to manage a tasklist by adding, deleting, organizing, managing and displaying todo items.
Useful to plan complex tasks and organize actionable steps within an extremely long context beyond the limits of underlying LLM.
Helps to keep planning structured and transparent.

Possible status values for a task:
 *  pending - The task in new and not processed yet
 *  in_progress - Set this status when you start to process a task. During execution of the task, write logs for all significant actions.
 *  done - Set this status after succesfully completing the task
 *  failed - Set this status to indicate that the task failed to complete succesfully. Write task log about the error.
 *  skipped - Set this status to indicate that the task has been skipped entirely. Write task log about the reason.

An example tasklist looks like this:
~~~json
[
  {
      "uid": "35dee229-037f-47a6-b7c3-73c23ee0c253",
      "name": "Test Task 0",
      "description": "...The task ist to...and then...to finally...",
      "status": "done",
  },
  {
      "uid": "35dee229-037f-47a6-b7c3-73c23ee0c253",
      "name": "Test Task 1",
      "description": "...The task ist to...and then...to finally...",
      "status": "in_progress",
  },
  {
      "uid": "35de2229-037f-47a6-b7c3-73cb3ee8c293",
      "name": "Test Task 2",
      "description": "...The task ist to...and then...to finally...",
      "status": "pending",
  },
]
~~~

The logs of a task can be displayed separately from tasklist items to save context space, a log of a task looks like this:
~~~json
[
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-02 11:23:54",
    "message": "...Some task action being logged..."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-02 11:32:50",
    "message": "...Another task action being logged..."
  },
  {
    "timestamp": "2025-01-02 11:33:00",
    "message": "...Task finished message..."
  }
]
